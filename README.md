# AppliedDS

This repository is a collection of projects and videos done for my Business Intelligence and Analytics Certificate.

### **Projects**  

I shared a technique for loading dataframes from Jupyter to MS SQL in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8fcV-YeuZ8). The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/abjumana/AppliedDS/blob/main/Technique_Load.ipynb).
