## Introduction
For my BI Project, I will be analyzing the 'Action For Health' dataset, diving deep into the heatlhcare system in Nova Scotia, using Python and PowerBI/Tableau. This data can be important to data-driven decision making. It will provide insights on what the current healthcare system has capacity for and can be further explored with other datasets? something like that?? Goal of the presentation is to ???
