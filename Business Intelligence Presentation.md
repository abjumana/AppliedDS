### This project will be a thorough analysis of Nova Scotia hospitals' total occupancy and their service volumes (emergency visits, admissions, surgical cases and more). I will be using Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis, SSMS for managing, querying and transforming the data and PowerBI for data visualization and reporting.

This data can be important to data-driven decision making. It will provide insights on what the current healthcare system has capacity for and can be further explored with other datasets? something like that?? Goal of the presentation is to ???

SMS (SQL Server Management Studio) for Data Storage and Transformation: If your dataset is stored in a SQL Server database, SSMS is a powerful tool for managing, querying, and transforming relational data. You can use SQL queries and scripts to perform more complex data transformations, aggregations, or joins, especially if your dataset is spread across multiple tables or requires complex data manipulations that are better suited for SQL.



"I will embark on a comprehensive analysis of the 'Action For Health' dataset, delving deep into Nova Scotia's healthcare system using Python and PowerBI/Tableau. This dataset is pivotal for informed decision-making, offering insights into our healthcare system's current capacity. Moreover, it opens avenues for further exploration when combined with other datasets.

The goal of the presentation is to showcase the significance of this dataset in guiding data-driven decisions. By highlighting its potential to reveal insights into healthcare capacity and utilization, we aim to underscore its importance in shaping strategic healthcare policies and practices. Ultimately, our aim is to empower stakeholders with the knowledge and tools needed to leverage data effectively for enhancing healthcare delivery and outcomes."


## Presentation Candidate
- My name is Jumana Abouelela and I am currently completing a graduate certificate in Business Intelligence and Analytics. I have a keen interest in the healthcare field and I have accumulated experience from working at the IWK Hospital for the last 3.5 years. This certificate has equipped me with the knowledge and tools to start my career in the Business Intelligence and Data Analytics fields where I will attempt to show my newly found skills and expertise in this presentation.


## Data Selection
The Action for Health is a Nova Scotia Government plan, aiming at making healthcare information accessible to the general public. The dataset includes information about patient numbers at all hospitals in Nova Scotia - admissions, surgeries, and more. It covers April 2021 to September 2023. 

- Relevance of the chosen data to the business domain

## Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration
- My main focus for this presentation is to showcase my reporting skills, creating reports and dashboards, in PowerBI. To get the data ready for reporting, I will complete EDA in Python Jupyter notebook. Anticipated insights and their impact on business strategies??

## Implementation Plan
- Rehearsals and feedback sessions

## Conclusion
- Recap of the expected contributions of the presentation
- Encouragement for audience engagement

## Appendices
- Bibliography of business intelligence literature
- Resources for additional learning and exploration
